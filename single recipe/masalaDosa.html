                Masala dosa is stuffed dosa. The two parts are the Dosa and the Stuffing. 
                The dosa is made in the usual way by soaking rice and lentils overnight 
                in water and then grinding it to a batter. The batter will be fermented 
                overnight to make the dosa soft from inside and crispy texture outside. 
                The stuffing is made from boiled potatoes with a seasoning of mustard
                seeds and garnishing of grated coconut, pinch of turmeric powder, coriander 
                leaves, and lemon juice.</p>

            <h2>Step 1:- Prepare the batter and ferment overnight</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Masala Dosa is one of the most popular South Indian delicacies. To prepare the batter for Masala Dosa, wash and soak the
            rice (with fenugreek added into it) and urad dal in separate containers for approximately 6-8 hours. Once the rice and
            urad dal are soaked well, grind them separately in a mixer using the water in which they were soaked, till the mixture
            reaches a smooth consistency. Mix the batter of both the ingredients in a bigger container and add salt to it. Combine
            well and allow it to ferment overnight.</p>
            <h2>Step 2:- Prepare the potato filling for Masala Dosa</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>To prepare the filling of the dosa, heat 2 tbsp oil in a thick-bottomed pan and let the mustard seeds splutter. Then,
            add sliced onions, curry leaves, green chillies and saute them till the onions turn pink. Then, add a pinch of salt,
            turmeric powder and mix them well. Now, take the cubed potatoes and add them to the sauteed onions and mix them
            together. Pour water gradually into the mixture and allow the potatoes to simmer for around 4 minutes. When the mixture
            is in semi-thick state, turn off the gas and let it rest for a few seconds.</p>
            <h2>Step 3:- Pan fry your dosa on a dosa tawa</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Now, take a dosa tawa and heat it on low-medium flame. Smear 1 tsp oil on it to prepare the dosa. When the tawa is hot,
            pour and spread the batter evenly in a circular motion.</p>
            <h2>Step 4:- Add filling and fold the dosa</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>When the colour of dosa's edges turns into brown, reduce the flame and sprinkle few drops of oil on the dosa sides and
            put 2 tablespoons of filling. Fold the dosa. Repeat the process until all the batter and filling is used up. Serve hot
            Masala Dosa with coconut chutney and sambhar.</p>
