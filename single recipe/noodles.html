                salt added.They are also often pan-fried or deep-fried. Noodle dishes can 
                include a sauce or noodles can be put into soup. The material composition 
                and geocultural origin is specific to each type of a wide variety of 
                noodles. Noodles are a staple food in many cultures (see Chinese
                noodles, Japanese noodles, Korean noodles, Filipino noodles, Vietnamese 
                noodles, and Italian pasta).</p>
