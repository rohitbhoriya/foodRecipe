                Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges
                such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated
                without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.</p>
                
                <p>Another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold unbaked
                to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to
                assemble at home before baking in an oven.</p>

            <h2>Step 1:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In large bowl, dissolve yeast and sugar in water; let stand for 5 minutes. Add oil and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a
            time, until a soft dough forms.</p>
            <h2>Step 2:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, 2-3 minutes. Place in a greased bowl, turning once to
            grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, cook beef and onion over
            medium heat until beef is no longer pink, breaking meat into crumbles; drain.</p>
            <h2>Step 3:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Punch down dough; divide in half. Press each half into a greased 12-in. pizza pan. Combine the tomato sauce, oregano and
            basil; spread over each crust. Top with beef mixture, green pepper and cheese.</p>
            <h2>Step 4:- </h2>
            <p>Bake at 400Â° for 25-30 minutes or until crust is lightly browned.</p>
