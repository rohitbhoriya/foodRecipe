            <p>Dal Makhani is one of the most popular recipes of North Indian cuisine (especially Punjabi) and it literally translates
            to buttery lentils. You will definitely find this rich and creamy dal/lentil on the menu of every possible North Indian
            restaurant all over the world.
            
            Restaurant-style dal makhani is a delicious combination of whole black lentils (urad), Bengal gram, and red kidney beans
            cooked with a lot of butter, heavy cream, and mild spices.</p>

        <div class="step">
            <h2>Step 1:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Wash and rinse urad dal (whole black lentil) and rajma (kidney beans) in a large bowl. Soak in 3 cups water overnight.</p>
            <h2>Step 2:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In the morning, drain the water in which the dal and rajma was soaked. Transfer the dal and rajma to a pressure cooker
            with 1 teaspoon salt. Add around 3.5 cups water.</p>
            <h2>Step 3:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Pressure cook on high-medium heat for 10 whistles, then lower the heat to low-medium and cook for another 10 minutes. In
                total around 15 to 20 whistles.
                </p>
            <h2>Step 4:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Let the pressure release naturally. The dal and rajma should be completely cooked and you should be able to mash them
                with your fingers.
                If using the Instant pot, pressure cook the lentils on high pressure for 30 minutes with natural pressure release.</p>
            <h2>Step 5:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Mash some of the dal and rajma using a potato masher. Then turn on the heat to lowest heat and let the dal simmer while
            you make the masala.</p>
            <h2>Step 6:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>To make the masala, in a large pot/pan, heat 2 tablespoons butter (I use and recommend amul salted butter here) and 1
            tablespoon ghee on medium heat.</p>
            <h2>Step 7:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Once the butter melts and is hot, add the finely grated onion. Cook the onion for around 6 to 7 minutes or until it
            turns light golden brown. Keep stirring it continuously so that it doesn't burn and keep heat on medium.</p>
            <h2>Step 8:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Add the ginger garlic paste and cook for 1 to 2 minute until the raw smell goes away.</p>
            <h2>Step 9:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Add the tomato puree and mix. Cook for 2 minutes or until the puree mixes well with masala and oil starts oozing out
            from the sides.</p>
            <h2>Step 10:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Add in the boiled dal (which had been simmering for around 10 to 15 mins you were making the masala) and mix.</p>
            <h2>Step 11:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Add garam masala, kashmiri red chili powder and salt. Mix to combine.</p>
            <h2>Step 12:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Add 1/2 cup water, stir and set heat to low. Let it simmer on low heat uncovered for around 45 minutes.</p>
            <h2>Step 13:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Stir often (every 10 minutes or so) else dal will stick to the bottom of the pot. You will also need to add water. I
            added total of 1.5 cups water as the dal was simmering.</p>
            <h2>Step 14:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Add sugar and mix after the dal has simmered for 45 minutes.</p>
            <h2>Step 15:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Also add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter and 1/4 cup cream. Mix well.</p>
            <h2>Step 16:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Simmer for 10 more minutes on low heat after adding the cream. Dal will become really creamy by now. You may serve the
            dal at this point or do the additional step of giving it a smokey flavor.</p>
            <h2>Step 17:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>This last step (dhungar method) is optional but recommend. For the smokey flavor, place a steel bowl on top of a trivet
            placed inside the dal. Then heat a piece of charcoal over direct heat until its red hot.</p>
            <h2>Step 18:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Place hot charcoal in that steel bowl on top of the trivet. Pour melted ghee (around 1 tablespoon) on top of charcoal.</p>
            <h2>Step 19:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>You will immediately see fumes coming out of charcoal. Immediately close the pan with a lid. Let it remain like this for
            2 minutes. After 2 minutes, remove lid and remove the bowl from dal. The longer you keep the lid closed, the smokier dal
            will get and for dal makhani I don't like it very smokey so 2 minutes was good for me. You may do 5 minutes but don't do
            more.</p>
            <h2>Step 20:- </h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Garnish dal makhani with more cream and serve with a pat of amul butter. Enjoy!</p>
