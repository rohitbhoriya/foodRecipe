            rice and lentils overnight in water and then grinding it to a batter. The batter will be fermented overnight to make the
            dosa soft from inside and crispy texture outside. The stuffing is made from boiled potatoes with a seasoning of mustard
            seeds and garnishing of grated coconut, pinch of turmeric powder, coriander leaves, and lemon juice.</p>

            <p>Pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges
            such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated
            without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.
            
            Another form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold unbaked
            to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to
            assemble at home before baking in an oven.</p>
